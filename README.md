# MySQL-Data-Exploration

My SQL data exploration project looks into covid numbers that were taken each day for every country. The dataset is available on Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

I have taken 2 different data sets to look at how the data has changed.

The first set was downloaded from the WHO website in May 2021. The reason for this was that around May was the first time that I saw the COVID-19 vaccine being widely available where I lived - where appointments were much easier to come by at our pharmacies.

The second version of the data was taken in July 2022, I wanted to contrast the numbers for each time period to visualize the difference in numbers after the vaccine was widely available for over 12 months.
